### **3D Shape Polymorphism in Java**

#### **Project Overview**

This program demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) by showcasing how polymorphism enables flexible and unified interactions across different types of 3D shapes. By defining a common interface and implementing it in multiple classes (Sphere, Cylinder, and Cube), the project emphasizes the power of abstraction and code reusability.

#### **Key Features**

- **Polymorphism:**  
  Enables seamless interaction with various 3D shapes (Sphere, Cylinder, Cube) through a shared interface. The program invokes methods (`surfaceArea()` and `volume()`) on objects of different types, allowing each shape to use its own implementation of these methods while conforming to the interface.

This project serves as a hands-on example of how polymorphism can simplify complex interactions, making the code more flexible and easier to maintain. Dive into the code and explore how each shape brings its unique calculations to the shared interface!

#### **Examples:**
