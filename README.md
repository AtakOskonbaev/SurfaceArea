# 3D Shape Polymorphism in Java 🧑‍💻🔲

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **3D Shape Polymorphism in Java** project! This program demonstrates the power of **polymorphism** in Java by creating an interface for 3D shapes and implementing it in different classes (`Sphere`, `Cylinder`, and `Cube`). Each class calculates the surface area and volume of its shape, but all adhere to a common interface, ensuring a unified interaction.

### **Key Features**:
- **Polymorphism**: Treats different 3D shapes (`Sphere`, `Cylinder`, and `Cube`) as instances of the same interface, allowing the program to call the same methods (`surfaceArea()` and `volume()`) across different shape types, while each shape implements its own version of these methods.
- **Encapsulation**: Each shape class encapsulates its properties (such as radius, height, and side length) and provides methods to calculate the surface area and volume based on its unique formula.
- **Randomization**: Random values are generated for shape dimensions, simulating a dynamic environment where each run creates new shapes with random sizes.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Follows OOP principles to create a clean, maintainable codebase.
